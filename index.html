			<h2>Bio</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
	<p>
		Before joining UIC, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/">Makoto Yokoo</a> in Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering at Kyushu University, and with <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/">Hau Chan</a> in Department of Computer Science \& Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I received my PhD in Operations Research from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~jingchen/">Xiaodong Hu</a> and <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~jingchen/">Xujin Chen</a>, 
		and a joint PhD in Computer Science from Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~jingchen/">Minming Li</a>.		
		I completed my B.S. in Applied Maths at Hua Loo-Keng Class, Beihang University.
