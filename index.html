			<h2>Short Bio</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
	<p>
		Before joining Comp@PolyU, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/edith.elkind/">Edith Elkind</a> in the Department of Computer Science at University of Oxford and with <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~nikolova/">Evdokia Nikolova</a> in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Texas at Austin. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I received my PhD from the Department of Computer Science at Stony Brook University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~jingchen/">Jing Chen</a>. 
		I completed my B.S. in Applied Maths and M.S. in Operations Research at Ocean University of China, under the supervision of <a href="http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/ms/2013/1231/c4086a14285/page.psp">Qizhi Fang</a>.
