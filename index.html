			<h2>Bio</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
	<p>
		I am current an Assistant Professor in the programme of Computer Science and Technology at UIC, and also an Associate Distinguished Research Fellow in the Institute of AI and Future Networks, Beijing Normal University, Zhuhai. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Before joining UIC and BNU in December 2021, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow working with <a href="https://kyushu-u.pure.elsevier.com/en/persons/makoto-yokoo">Makoto Yokoo</a> (the first AAAI Fellow in Asia) in Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering at Kyushu University, 
		and with <a href="https://cse.unl.edu/~hchan/">Hau Chan</a> in Department of Computer Science & Engineering at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
		I received my PhD in Operations Research from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of <a href="http://people.ucas.edu.cn/~xdhu">Xiaodong Hu</a> and <a href="http://people.ucas.ac.cn/~xchen">Xujin Chen</a>, 
		and a joint PhD in Computer Science from Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of <a href="https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~minmli/">Minming Li</a>.		
		I completed my B.S. in Applied Maths at Hua Loo-Keng Class, Beihang University.
